Intro:

This round of changes does not include all of the IDE 
stuff. You may encounter some issues with dependencies
on the new CVS version of SynEdit. Please let me know
what issues you encounter. Once we get the baseline
established I will complete the integration of the IDE 
enhancements. There is some more polish needed in 
several areas so there's more to do before it can be 
a full public release. 

I welcome all feedback and questions! If you don't
like something then speak up!

Change log:

Major changes...
===================================================
+ Renamed component to Tdws2IdeDialog
+ Removed AFLabsAboutBox.pas from package
+ Restructured component to use events to access 
  scripts (Load/Save/SaveAs).
+ Removed dws2CompilerBeta (differences were moved 
  to dws2Compiler)
+ Changed component graphic.
+ Register component on DWS2 tab.


Change in logic of working with scripts...
===================================================
I wanted to decouple the editor from the component so 
it can remove the 'event chains' and allows the 
editor to be embedded in other ways. I did this 
through a new unit called "dwsIDETypes.pas". This
defines the types and interfaces needed.

I also changed the editor to NOT KNOW anything about 
files. This means a script can be obtained from 
anywhere. Also, this allows the user to load 
a script and perhaps decrypt it (if encrypted) before 
loading it into the editor.

With our scripts (at my work), they will be encrypted 
in a database available to our application. When you 
'open' a script the event will fire and our app will 
show a dialog listing all the scripts that can be 
openned and once selected, the script can be loaded.

- Removed OpenDialog and SaveDialog
+ Added SaveDialog to demo main form
+ Created OnLoadScript event
+ Created OnSaveScript event 
+ Created OnSaveAsScript event 
+ Created OnAboutBox event to allow customization
+ Created OnHelp event to allow customization
+ Created unit "dwsIDETypes.pas"
= NOTE: I kept the OnSaved event (not sure how you use it). 
  I have no reason to keep it. We can remove if desired.

Editor changes...
===================================================
+ Made appearance more configurable. You have your 
  style, I have mine. :)
+ Added /SOME/ IDE code enhancements
  + Added TreeView (needs improved integration)
  + Added ClassCompletion (CTRL+SHIFT+C, on popup menu)
    Not yet completed, I broke it recently while trying
    to add support for property arrays.
  + "Find Declaration" jump (CTRL+SHIFT+UP) Jump from 
    method declaration to implementation. Will also 
    jump on functions if there is a forward declared.
+ Changed the main menu (not ideal but good enough)
+ Changed arrangement of menu buttons.
+ Added "SynEditTypes" to implementation uses (needed
  for new CVS SynEdit code)
+ MemoInputOutput added scroll bars (if you would run
  BubbleSort but add "DoBubbleSort;" as last line the
  output would be off the edge of output)
+ MemoInputOutput.ReadOnly := True (don't let people 
  type there)
+ Fixed bug: CBImmediateKeyPress(). An immediate eval
  of something without a "?" would AV. Changed to set
  text to command if no "?" is provided. Why is that 
  used anyway?
+ Tried to change ToolTip debug hint to not throw AVs
  but it still needs to be reworked using SynEdit hints.

Other changes...
===================================================
+ frm_EditorConfirmReplace - position ScreenCenter
+ frm_EditorSearch - position ScreenCenter
+ dws2ThreadedDebugger.pas - Added "const" to params 
  for "SetProcedureName" (const Params: array of variant)
+ Moved global variables used for SynEdit find/replace 
  forms to be unit local (below implementation). No 
  reason I know of to share it with the world. Could
  conflict with other SynEdit users?
+ Added TODO items to code.. some areas need completion
  or fixing.
+ Updated Demo to work with new component type and format
+ stuff I'm sure I forgot... ;)
