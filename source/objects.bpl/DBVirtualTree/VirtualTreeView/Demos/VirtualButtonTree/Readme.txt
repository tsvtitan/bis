This code is my contribution to Mike Lischke's great component VirtualStringTree.

This descendant adds the ability to add buttons in the node cells.


It's easy to add the buttons, i think examples are the best docuumentation so simply
see the attached example.

If you find a bug, add some cool features or improvments on this code please send me a copy
to luisdav@hotmail.com

Sicerely.
