If you have trouble installing related to VCLDB50.bpi, 
1. ignore the errors,

Changes from official versions:
  As VSTEdit seems not to be updated any more,
    I have changed PrepareEdit signature to keep
    it compatible with VT 2.6.11.

For solution to problems with _di_IVTEditLink in
  BCB look in Source\VSTEdit\Readme.txt.
