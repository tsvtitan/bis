TPrinterPreview object
TPrinterPreview lets you to record printable data in buffer for following 
output them on screen and to printer. TPrinterPreview have all functions and 
properties as in TPrinter object. You can use TPrinterPreview object similarly 
of TPrinter except some details. In TPrinter Printer.Canvas.Handle and 
Printer.Handle is the same but in TPrinterPreview PrinterPreview.Canvas.Handle
represent the metafile in that is recored the data and PrinterPreview.Handle 
represent Printer.Handle. That is mean that you have to use 
PrinterPreview.Canvas.Handle for draw operation (DrawText, DrawTexteEx, e.t.c.) 
and use PrinterPreview.Handle in functions that return information about 
printer facilities (GetDeviceCaps, e.t.c.). Global function PrinterPreview 
returns default PrinterPreview object and shows data in default preview form.

with a scrollable list and can display and edit a field in a dataset or can 
works as non data-aware combo edit control.

TDBNumberEditEh component 
represents a single-line number edit control that can display and edit a numeric 
field in a dataset or can works as non data-aware edit control.

Components realize technology to store component properties to/from settings 
storage such as ini files, registry etc.

--------------------
Installation Library
--------------------

If you have executable installation program (for example, EhLibSetupD7Eval.exe)
then you only need to run program and follow installation process. Setup automatically
writes all units in necessary directory, installs packages and help files in IDE.

To install files from self-extracting EhLib archive follow next instructions:


1. Delphi 9.X Vcl.Net
---------------------

Uninstall previous or evaluation version of EhLib (Old version) from Delphi
IDE. Remove or copy to other directory files of old version to prevent
crossing old and new version of EhLib (Including Vcl.EhLib.dll, Vcl.DclEhLib.dll files).

Create directory from which you will install EhLib library
('EhLib directory') (for example, C:\Delphi9\EhLibVclNet).

Copy files from Common and Delphi9 directories of the EhLib archive
to 'EhLib directory'.

In Delphi IDE:

Add, (if needed) 'EhLib directory' in Component->Installed .NET Components ...->
  Assembly Search Paths.
Add, (if needed) 'EhLib directory' in Tools->Options->Environment Options->
Delphi Options->Library - NET->Library Path.

Use "File\Open..." menu item of Delphi IDE to open the runtime package -
Vcl.EhLibXX.Dpk.
In "Project Manager..." window, click right button above 'Vcl.EhLibXX.Dll' and
select "Build" menu to compile package.

Use "File\Open..." menu item of Delphi IDE to open the runtime package -
Vcl.DclEhLibXX.Dpk.
In "Project Manager..." window, click right button above 'Vcl.DclEhLibXX.Dll' and
select "Build" menu to compile package.
Open menu "Component->Installed .NET Components ..."->.NET VCL Components.
Press 'Add...' button. Locate 'Vcl.DclEhLibXX.dll' and press 'Open'.
(By default, this file have to be located in 'EhLib directory' directory)
Press 'Ok' in 'Installed .NET Components' Dialog. 

1. Delphi 8.x (Vcl.Net)
-----------------------

Uninstall previous or evaluation version of EhLib (Old version) from Delphi 
IDE. Remove or copy to other directory files of old version to prevent 
crossing old and new version of EhLib (Including EhLib.dll, DclEhLib.dll files). 

Create directory from which you will install EhLib library 
('EhLib directory') (for example, C:\Delphi8\EhLib).

Copy files from Common and Delphi8 directories of the EhLib archive
to 'EhLib directory'.

In Delphi IDE:

Add, (if needed) 'EhLib directory' in Component->Installed .NET Components ...->
  Environment Options->Assembly Search Paths.
Add, (if needed) 'EhLib directory' in Tools->Options->Environment Options->
Delphi Options->Library->Library Path.

Use "File\Open..." menu item of Delphi IDE to open the runtime package - 
EhLibXX.Dpk.
In "Project Manager..." window, click right button above 'EhLibXX.Dll' and 
select "Build" menu to compile package.

Use "File\Open..." menu item of Delphi IDE to open the runtime package - 
DclEhLibXX.Dpk.
In "Project Manager..." window, click right button above 'DclEhLibXX.Dll' and 
select "Install VCL Package" menu to install package.


2. Delphi 4.x - 7.x, Delphi 9.X Win32:
-------------------------------------

Uninstall previous or evaluation version of EhLib (Old version) from Delphi 
IDE. Remove or copy to other directory files of old version to prevent 
crossing old and new version of EhLib (Including EhLib.bpl, EhLib.dcp or 
EhLibXX.bpl, EhLibXX.dcp files). 

Create directory from which you will install EhLib library 
('EhLib directory') (for example, C:\Delphi[X]\EhLib).

Copy files from Common and Delphi[X] directories of the EhLib archive
to 'EhLib directory'.

Use "File\Open..." menu item of Delphi IDE to open the runtime package - 
EhLibXX.Dpk.
In "Package..." window click "Compile" button to compile the package.

By default Delphi (5, 6 and 7) place compiled EhLibXX.BPL file to the 
<Delphi path>\Projects\Bpl directory and this directory already present 
in the search PATH. But if you overwrite default BPL directory then you need
put compiled EhLibXX.BPL file into directory that is accessible 
through the search PATH (i.e. DOS "PATH" environment variable; for example, 
in the Windows\System directory).

Add, (if needed) 'EhLib directory' in Tools->Environment Options->Library->
Library Path (For Delphi 9 in Tools->Options->Environment Options->
Delphi Options->Library - Win32->Library Path).

After compiling run-time package you must install design-time
package DclEhLibXX.BPL into the IDE.

Use "File\Open..." menu item to open design-time package DclEhLibXX.Dpk.
In "Package..." window click "Compile" button to compile the package
and then click "Install" button to register EhLib components on
the component palette. 

EhLib components have to appear on 'EhLib' page of components palette.


3. C++Builder 4.x - 6.x:
------------------------

Uninstall previous or evaluation version of EhLib from C++Builder IDE.
Remove or copy to other directory files of old version to prevent 
crossing old and new version of EhLib (Including EhLib.bpl, EhLib.bpi or 
EhLibB[X].bpl, EhLibB[X].bpi files). 


Create directory from which you will install EhLib library 
('EhLib directory') (for example, C:\CBuilder[X]\EhLib).

Copy files from Common and BCB[X] directories of the EhLib archive
to 'EhLib directory'.

Use "File\Open..." menu item of C++Builder IDE to open the runtime package - 
EhLibB[X].Dpk.
In "Package..." window click "Compile" button to compile the package.

By default Builder (5 and 6) place compiled EhLibB[X].BPL file to the 
<Builder path>\Projects\Bpl directory and this directory already present 
in the search PATH. But if you overwrite default BPL directory then you need
put compiled EhLibB[X].BPL file into directory that is accessible 
through the search PATH (i.e. DOS "PATH" environment variable; for example, 
in the Windows\System directory).

Add, (if needed) 'EhLib directory' in Tools->Environment Options->Library->
Library Path.

After compiling run-time package you must install design-time
package DclEhLibB[X].BPL into the IDE.

Use "File\Open..." menu item to open design-time package DclEhLibB[X].BPL.
In "Package..." window click "Compile" button to compile the package
and then click "Install" button to register EhLib components on
the component palette. 

EhLib components have to appear on 'EhLib' page of components palette.


4. Instalation note for users who had EhLib 1.X or 2.X:
------------------------------------------------------

Note that Delphi IDE does not move components to the new default 
place on components palette when you install new version of same 
component(s). So if you already has EhLib installed, then installation 
new (3.0) version does not move EhLib components to the 'EhLib' page. 
To force Delphi IDE to move compontes to the default 
place on components palette do next:
Open menu: Component->Configure Palette.
             Select '[All]' line in Pages listbox.
             Click 'Default Pages' button.


Installation Help
-----------------

1. This version of library doesn't have help files for Delphi8.

2. Delphi 4.x - 7.x:

Copy the EhLib.hlp and EhLib.cnt files to the Delphi HELP subdirectory.
Select Help|Customize to start the OpenHelp application. Add the EhLib.cnt 
file to the Contents page, add the EhLib.hlp file to the Index and Link pages.

3. C++Builder 4.x - 6.x: 

Copy the EhLib.hlp and EhLib.cnt files to the C++Builder HELP subdirectory.
Select Help|Customize to start the OpenHelp application. Add the EhLib.cnt 
file to the Contents page, add the EhLib.hlp file to the Index and Link pages.
