<h1>Includes Demonstration</h1>
<p>There are two different kind of includes:</p>
<h2>HTML Includes</h2>
<p>If you have a navigation bar or 
something similar that is part of many pages you can place the HTML code of
this navigation bar in a new file and include it in all other pages</p>
<p>If the included HTML file contains embedded DWS scripts the script are executed!</p>
<pre>
{$ADAPTER 'htmlinc.dws'}
</pre>
<% 
{$ADAPTER 'htmlinc.dws'}
%>
<h2>Script Includes</h2>
<p>Maybe you use some common constants on you website. E. g. the e-mail 
address of the web master. Or maybe you have some utility function that should be
available in different pages. In this case you should place this script code
in a new file and include it in evey page where your need this code:</p>
<p>Script includes musn't contain any HTML code!</p>
<pre>
{$INCLUDE 'codeinc.dws'}
SendLn('Webmaster: ' + CNST_WebMaster);
</pre>
<%
{$INCLUDE 'codeinc.dws'}
SendLn('Webmaster: ' + CNST_WebMaster);
%>
