------------------------

This project was created to fill the lack of
a local debugger component for DWSII.

The original code was written by Danilo Luiz
Rheinheimer for his Remote Debugger.

If anyone has some tips about "To Do" list
below, please tell me.



To do:
------------------------

- Support to multiple files (includes?)
- Support to multiple programs at time
- Identify lines with executable code (statements)
- Make a "remote" version
- Execute statements during debug



Log changes:
------------------------

v1.2: Debugger thread changed to fiber to avoid problems
        with non-threadsafe VCL code
        (Thanks to Mark Erickssen!)        

v1.1: Core evaluate routines rewritten
        (much better evaluation support)
      Modify values of evaluated variables/fields
      Program execution now runs on a secondary thread
        (controlled by debugger)
      Fixed A/V when resetting program execution
        (Thanks to Roberto Cornacchia!)

v1.0: Initial release (named as Tdws2NotSoSimpleDebugger).
